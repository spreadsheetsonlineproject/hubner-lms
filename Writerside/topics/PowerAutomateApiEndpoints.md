# API Endpoints

The purpose of the API backend is centralized the interactions between the user
interface and the database. This layer of the software separates tasks like
visualizing data and changing them in the database. API allow to control the
read and write operations in a single separated place, which is individual from
other parts of the application.

Other advantages of a centralized API are the maintenance of the system and
the consistency.
